###### Portfolio-of-Valeri
##### 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Valeri!
##### Currently, I am an aspiring data scientist, who seeks a new career after a career in Ed Tech.
##### My new Master of Science in Business Analytics from Graziadio Business School has inspired me. 
###### 🔍With Vanilla Ice words, I am ready to Stop. Collaborate. Listen.  My interest is to share ideas, learnings and projects. 
######    Data Analytics and my programming skills are developing, like these in SQL, R, Python and data visualizations using Tableau, Alteryx and Microsoft BI. 
######  ✉️ Your questions and feedback are welcome. :)
